#ExceptionTesting

Small project looking at different ways of verifying exceptions are thrown in Java. 

Created as example code for an upcoming blog post.

## Known issues

Due to how the example is constructed, one of the tests will fail if you attempt to build the whole project. This is somewhat annoying, but is meant a starting point to investigate whether the test is actually checking what you want.
